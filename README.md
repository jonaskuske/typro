\- **the app to identify fonts easily.**  
 
This repository contains code for a concept of an app that identifies and manages fonts: "typro".  

It was created as a final project of the course "programming" at university.  
The web app runs entirely on client side and uses JavaScript to let users take and store pictures, explore a font catalogue and view already taken pictures and their details, like time, date and the identified font. Actual optical image recognition isn't implemented, so the recognition is simulated by attaching a random font from the catalogue to each scanned image.  

This project is set up as a progressive web app (PWA), so try adding it to your phone's homescreen. It will look like a native app and work even offline! (on supported browser engines)
